React Component Structure: The code defines a functional component named CurriculumOrganizer.

State Variables: It initializes several state variables using the useState hook:
     - courses: An array to store the list of courses.
     - newCourseName: A string to store the name of the new course being added.
     - editingIndex: An integer representing the index of the course currently being edited.
     - editedCourseName: A string to store the edited name of the course.
     
Effects for Local Storage: The useEffect hook is used twice:
     - First, to load the list of courses from local storage when the component mounts.
     - Second, to save the updated list of courses to local storage whenever the courses state changes.

Event Handlers:
   - addCourse: Adds a new course to the list of courses.
   - startEditing: Sets the editingIndex and editedCourseName state variables to start editing a course.
   - saveEdit: Saves the edited name of the course.
   - deleteCourse: Deletes a course from the list.

Rendering: Inside the return statement, the JSX code defines the structure of the component:
        - It renders a heading "Curriculum Organizer".
        - It renders an input field and a button to add a new course.
        - It maps through the courses array and renders each course as a list item (<li>).
        - For each course, it renders either an input field and a "Save" button (if the course is being edited) or the course name and "Edit"/"Delete" buttons.

CSS Styling:
    - The CSS file CurriculumOrganizer.css contains styles to visually enhance the component.
    - It styles the container (curriculum-organizer) with a background image from Unsplash, a box shadow, and text color.
    - It styles the input field, buttons, and list items for better visibility and interaction.
    - Hover effects are added to list items and buttons to provide visual feedback to users.

Background Image:
    - The background image is set using the background property in CSS for the .curriculum-organizer class.
    - The background-size: cover; property ensures that the background image covers the entire screen.
    - The background-repeat: no-repeat; property prevents the image from repeating.
    - The background-position: center center; property centers the background image.

Interactivity:
    - Hover effects are added to list items and buttons using CSS to make the application more interactive and visually appealing.
    - When hovering over a list item, the background color changes to provide visual feedback.
    - Similarly, hover effects are added to the "Edit", "Save", and "Delete" buttons to change their background color when hovered over.
